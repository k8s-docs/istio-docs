==================================

Learn how to implement a new adapter for Mixer by consulting the
`Adapter Developer’s
Guide <https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Mixer-Compiled-In-Adapter-Dev-Guide>`_.

.. note::

   Istio 1.0 introduces initial support for out-of-process
adapters. This will be the recommended approach moving forward for
integrating with Mixer. Initial documentation on how to build an
out-of-process adapter is provided by the `Out Of Process Adapter Dev
Guide <https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Mixer-Out-Of-Process-Adapter-Dev-Guide>`_
and the `Out of Process Adapter
Walk-through <https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Mixer-Out-Of-Process-Adapter-Walkthrough>`_.
