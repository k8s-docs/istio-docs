dns-cert
================================================

By default, Citadel manages the DNS certificates of the Istio control
plane. Citadel is a large component that maintains its own private
signing key, and acts as a Certificate Authority (CA).

New in Istio 1.4, we introduce a feature to securely provision and
manage DNS certificates signed by the Kubernetes CA, which has the
following advantages.

-  Lighter weight DNS certificate management with no dependency on
   Citadel.

-  Unlike Citadel, this feature doesnâ€™t maintain a private signing key,
   which enhances security.

-  Simplified root certificate distribution to TLS clients. Clients no
   longer need to wait for Citadel to generate and distribute its CA
   certificate.

The following diagram shows the architecture of provisioning and
managing DNS certificates in Istio. Chiron is the component provisioning
and managing DNS certificates in Istio.
