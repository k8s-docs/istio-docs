================================================

Welcome to the Istio blog!

To make it easier to publish your content on our website, we `updated
the content types
guide </about/contribute/add-content/#content-types>`_.

The goal of the updated guide is to make sharing and finding content
easier.

We want to make sharing timely information on Istio easy and the `Istio
blog </blog>`_ is a good place to start.

We welcome your posts to the blog if you think your content falls in one
of the following four categories:

-  Your post details your experience using and configuring Istio.
   Ideally, your post shares a novel experience or perspective.
-  Your post highlights Istio features.
-  Your post details how to accomplish a task or fulfill a specific use
   case using Istio.

Posting your blog is only `one PR away </about/contribute/github/>`_
and, if you wish, you can `request a
review </about/contribute/review>`_.

We look forward to reading about your Istio experience on the blog soon!
