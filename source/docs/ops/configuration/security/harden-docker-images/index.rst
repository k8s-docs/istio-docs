harden-docker-images
==============================================

To ease the process of hardening docker images, Istio provides a set of
images based on `distroless
images <https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless>`_

.. warning::

   The *distroless images* are work-in-progress. The
following images havenâ€™t been updated to support *distroless*:

-  ``proxyproxy``
-  ``proxy_debug``
-  ``kubectl``
-  ``app_sidecar``

For ease of the installation, they are available with a ``-distroless``
suffix.

Install distroless images
-------------------------

Follow the `Installation Steps </docs/setup/install/istioctl/>`_ to
setup Istio. Add the option
``--set tag={{< istio_full_version >}}-distroless`` to use the
*distroless images*.

Benefits
--------

Non-essential executables and libraries are no longer part of the images
when using the distroless variant.

-  The attack surface is reduced. Include the smallest possible set of
   vulnerabilities.
-  The images are smaller, which allows faster start-up.

See also the `Why should I use distroless
images? <https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless#why-should-i-use-distroless-images>`_
section in the official distroless README.

.. warning::

   Be aware that common debugging tools such as ``bash``,
``curl``, ``netcat``, ``tcpdump``, etc. are not available on distroless
images.
