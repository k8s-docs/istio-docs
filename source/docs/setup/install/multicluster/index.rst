Multicluster Installation
============================

.. note::

   Note that these instructions are not mutually exclusive. In
a large multicluster deployment, composed from more than two clusters, a
combination of the approaches can be used. For example, two clusters
might share a control plane while a third has its own.

Refer to the `multicluster deployment
model </docs/ops/deployment/deployment-models/#multiple-clusters>`_
concept documentation for more information.
