lightstep
============================

This task shows you how to configure Istio to collect trace spans and
send them to `LightStep Tracing <https://lightstep.com/products/>`_ or
`LightStep [ùë•]PM <https://lightstep.com/products/>`_. LightStep lets
you analyze 100% of unsampled transaction data from large-scale
production software to produce meaningful distributed traces and metrics
that help explain performance behaviors and accelerate root cause
analysis. At the end of this task, Istio sends trace spans from the
proxies to a LightStep Satellite pool making them available to the web
UI.

This task uses the `Bookinfo </docs/examples/bookinfo/>`_ sample
application as an example.

Before you begin
----------------

1. Ensure you have a LightStep account. `Sign
   up <https://lightstep.com/products/tracing/>`_ for a free trial of
   LightStep Tracing, or `Contact
   LightStep <https://lightstep.com/contact/>`_ to create an
   enterprise-level LightStep [ùë•]PM account.

2. For [ùë•]PM users, ensure you have a satellite pool configured with TLS
   certs and a secure GRPC port exposed. See `LightStep Satellite
   Setup <https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/install-and-configure-satellites>`_
   for details about setting up satellites.

   For LightStep Tracing users, your satellites are already configured.

3. Ensure sure you have a LightStep `access
   token <https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/create-and-manage-access-tokens>`_.

4. You‚Äôll need to deploy Istio with your satellite address. For [ùë•]PM
   users, ensure you can reach the satellite pool at an address in the
   format ``<Host>:<Port>``, for example
   ``lightstep-satellite.lightstep:9292``.

   For LightStep Tracing users, use the address
   ``collector-grpc.lightstep.com:443``.

5. Deploy Istio with the following configuration parameters specified:

   -  ``pilot.traceSampling=100``
   -  ``global.proxy.tracer="lightstep"``
   -  ``global.tracer.lightstep.address="<satellite-address>"``
   -  ``global.tracer.lightstep.accessToken="<access-token>"``
   -  ``global.tracer.lightstep.secure=true``
   -  ``global.tracer.lightstep.cacertPath="/etc/lightstep/cacert.pem"``

   You can set these parameters using the ``--set key=value`` syntax
   when you run the install command. For example:

   | .. code:: sh

      $ istioctl manifest apply
   | ‚Äìset values.pilot.traceSampling=100
   | ‚Äìset values.global.proxy.tracer=‚Äúlightstep‚Äù
   | ‚Äìset values.global.tracer.lightstep.address=‚Äú‚Äù
   | ‚Äìset values.global.tracer.lightstep.accessToken=‚Äú‚Äù
   | ‚Äìset values.global.tracer.lightstep.secure=true
   | ‚Äìset
     values.global.tracer.lightstep.cacertPath=‚Äú/etc/lightstep/cacert.pem‚Äù


6. Store your satellite pool‚Äôs certificate authority certificate as a
   secret in the default namespace. For LightStep Tracing users,
   download and use `this
   certificate <https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/instrument-with-istio-as-your-service-mesh>`_.
   If you deploy the Bookinfo application in a different namespace,
   create the secret in that namespace instead.

   .. code:: sh

      $ CACERT=$(cat Cert_Auth.crt \| base64) #
   Cert_Auth.crt contains the necessary CACert $ NAMESPACE=default

   .. code:: sh

      $ cat <<EOF \| kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret metadata: name: lightstep.cacert namespace: $NAMESPACE
   labels: app: lightstep type: Opaque data: cacert.pem: $CACERT EOF

7. Follow the `instructions to deploy the Bookinfo sample
   application </docs/examples/bookinfo/#deploying-the-application>`_.

Visualize trace data
--------------------

1. Follow the `instructions to create an ingress gateway for the
   Bookinfo
   application </docs/examples/bookinfo/#determine-the-ingress-ip-and-port>`_.

2. To verify the previous step‚Äôs success, confirm that you set
   ``GATEWAY_URL`` environment variable in your shell.

3. Send traffic to the sample application.

   .. code:: sh

      $ curl http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage {{< /text
   >}}

4. Load the LightStep `web UI <https://app.lightstep.com/>`_.

5. Navigate to Explorer.

6. Find the query bar at the top. The query bar allows you to
   interactively filter results by a **Service**, **Operation**, and
   **Tag** values.

7. Select ``productpage.default`` from the **Service** drop-down list.

8. Click **Run**. You see something similar to the following:

.. image::./istio-tracing-list-lightstep.png
   :alt:
   :caption:Explorer
   :width: 80%

9. Click on the first row in the table of example traces below the
   latency histogram to see the details corresponding to your refresh of
   the ``/productpage``. The page then looks similar to:

.. image::./istio-tracing-details-lightstep.png
   :alt:
   :caption:Detailed Trace View
   :width: 80%

The screenshot shows that the trace is comprised of a set of spans. Each
span corresponds to a Bookinfo service invoked during the execution of a
``/productpage`` request.

Two spans in the trace represent every RPC. For example, the call from
``productpage`` to ``reviews`` starts with the span labeled with the
``reviews.default.svc.cluster.local:9080/*`` operation and the
``productpage.default: proxy client`` service. This service represents
the client-side span of the call. The screenshot shows that the call
took 15.30 ms. The second span is labeled with the
``reviews.default.svc.cluster.local:9080/*`` operation and the
``reviews.default: proxy server`` service. The second span is a child of
the first span and represents the server-side span of the call. The
screenshot shows that the call took 14.60 ms.

.. warning::

   The LightStep integration does not currently capture
spans generated by Istio‚Äôs internal operation components such as Mixer.


Trace sampling
--------------

Istio captures traces at a configurable trace sampling percentage. To
learn how to modify the trace sampling percentage, visit the
`Distributed Tracing trace sampling
section <../overview/#trace-sampling>`_. When using LightStep, we do
not recommend reducing the trace sampling percentage below 100%. To
handle a high traffic mesh, consider scaling up the size of your
satellite pool.

Cleanup
-------

If you are not planning any follow-up tasks, remove the Bookinfo sample
application and any LightStep secrets from your cluster.

1. To remove the Bookinfo application, refer to the `Bookinfo
   cleanup </docs/examples/bookinfo/#cleanup>`_ instructions.

2. Remove the secret generated for LightStep:

.. code:: sh

      $ kubectl delete secret lightstep.cacert
