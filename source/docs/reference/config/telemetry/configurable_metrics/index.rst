Configurable metrics
=========================

Istio 1.5 includes ``experimental`` support for modifying Istio standard
metrics and defining new ones.

The configuration steps are documented on the Istio
`wiki <https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Configurable-V2-Metrics>`_.

.. warning::

   The API to configure the metrics is certain to change in
Istio 1.6 as part of the extensions API design. {{</ warning>}}
