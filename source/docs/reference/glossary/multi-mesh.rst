multi mesh
==============================================

Multi-mesh is a deployment model that consists of two or more `service
meshes </docs/reference/glossary/#service-mesh>`_. Each mesh has
independent administration for naming and identities but you can expose
services between meshes through `mesh
federation </docs/reference/glossary/#mesh-federation>`_. The resulting
deployment is a multi-mesh deployment.
