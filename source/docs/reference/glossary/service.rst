service
==============================================

A delineated group of related behaviors within a `service
mesh </docs/reference/glossary/#service-mesh>`_. Services are
identified using a `service
name </docs/reference/glossary/#service-name>`_, and Istio policies
such as load balancing and routing are applied using these names. A
service is typically materialized by one or more `service
endpoints </docs/reference/glossary/#service-endpoint>`_, and may
consist of multiple `service
versions </docs/reference/glossary/#service-version>`_.
