data plane
==============================================

The data plane is the part of the mesh that directly controls
communication between workload instances. Istioâ€™s data plane uses
intelligent `Envoy </docs/reference/glossary/#envoy>`_ proxies deployed
as sidecars to mediate and control all traffic that your mesh services
send and receive.
