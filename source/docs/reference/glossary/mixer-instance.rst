mixer instance
==============================================

An instance represents a chunk of Mixer data that is produced by
inspecting a set of request
`attributes </docs/reference/glossary/#attribute>`_ and applying the
operator-supplied configuration. Instances are delivered to individual
`handlers </docs/reference/glossary/#mixer-handler>`_, on their way to
infrastructure backends.
