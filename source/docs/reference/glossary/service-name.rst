service name
==============================================

A name that uniquely identifies a
`service </docs/reference/glossary/#service>`_ within the `service
mesh </docs/reference/glossary/#service-mesh>`_. A service may not be
renamed while maintaining its identity. A service may have multiple
`versions </docs/reference/glossary/#service-version>`_, but a service
name is version-independent.
