pod
==============================================

A Pod is a group of one or more containers (such as
`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ containers), with shared storage
and network, and a specification for how to run the containers. Pods are
the `workload instances </docs/reference/glossary/#workload-instance>`_
in a
`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/>`_
deployment of Istio.
