announcing-1.0-eol-final
==============================

As `previously announced </news/support/announcing-1.0-eol/>`_, support
for Istio 1.0 has now officially ended.

We will no longer back-port fixes for security issues and critical bugs
to 1.0, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio
({{}}) if you havenâ€™t already.
