announcing-1.2-eol-final
===========================

As `previously announced </news/support/announcing-1.2-eol/>`_, support
for Istio 1.2 has now officially ended.

At this point we will no longer back-port fixes for security issues and
critical bugs to 1.2, so we heartily encourage you to upgrade to the
latest version of Istio ({{}}) if you havenâ€™t already.
