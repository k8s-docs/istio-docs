announcing-1.3-eol-final
=============================

As `previously announced </news/support/announcing-1.3-eol/>`_, support
for Istio 1.3 has now officially ended.

At this point we will no longer back-port fixes for security issues and
critical bugs to 1.3, so we heartily encourage you to upgrade to the
latest version of Istio ({{}}) if you havenâ€™t already.
