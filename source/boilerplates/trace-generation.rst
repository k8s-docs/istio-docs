trace-generation
=================================

To see trace data, you must send requests to your service. The number of
requests depends on Istio’s sampling rate. You set this rate when you
install Istio. The default sampling rate is 1%. You need to send at
least 100 requests before the first trace is visible. To send a 100
requests to the ``productpage`` service, use the following command:

.. code:: sh

      $ for i in ``seq 1 100``; do curl -s -o /dev/null
http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage; done
