"Deploy Istio across a small number of large clusters, rather than a large"
" number of small clusters. Instead of adding clusters to your deployment,"
" the best practice is to use `namespace tenancy </docs/ops/deployment"
"/deployment-models/#namespace-tenancy>`_ to manage large clusters. "
"Following this approach, you can deploy Istio across one or two clusters "
"per zone or region. You can then deploy a control plane on one cluster "
"per region or zone for added reliability."
