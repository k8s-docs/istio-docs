"Currently, the service discovery platform populates the locality "

"deployed. If you are using a hosted Kubernetes service your cloud "
"provider should configure this for you. If you are running your own "
"Kubernetes cluster you will need to add these labels to your nodes. The "
"sub-zone concept doesn’t exist in Kubernetes. As a result, Istio "
"introduced the custom node label ``topology.istio.io/subzone`` to define "

"*Locality-prioritized load balancing* is the default behavior for "
"*locality load balancing*. In this mode, Istio tells Envoy to prioritize "
"traffic to the workload instances most closely matching the locality of "
"the Envoy sending the request. When all instances are healthy, the "
"requests remains within the same locality. When instances become "
"unhealthy, traffic spills over to instances in the next prioritized "
"locality. This behavior continues until all localities are receiving "
"traffic. You can find the exact percentages in the `Envoy documentation "
