"Identity is a fundamental security infrastructure concept. The Istio "
"identity model is based on a first-class workload identity. At the "
"beginning of service-to-service communication, the two parties exchange "
"credentials with their identity information for mutual authentication "
"purposes."

"Using identity, servers can audit the time information was accessed and "
"what information was accessed by a specific client. They can also charge "
"clients based on the services they use and reject any clients that failed"
" to pay their bill from accessing the services."

"The Istio identity model is flexible and granular enough to represent a "
"human user, an individual service, or a group of services. On platforms "
"without first-class service identity, Istio can use other identities that"
" can group service instances, such as service names."
