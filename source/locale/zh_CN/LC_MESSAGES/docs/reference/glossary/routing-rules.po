"Routing rules, which you configure in a `virtual service </docs/concepts"
"/traffic-management/#virtual-services>`_, define the paths that requests "
"follow within the service mesh. With routing rules, you can define "
"conditions to route traffic addressed to the virtual serviceâ€™s host to "
"specific destination workloads. Routing rules let you control traffic for"
" tasks like A/B testing, canary rollouts, and staged rollouts with "
"percentage-based traffic splits."
