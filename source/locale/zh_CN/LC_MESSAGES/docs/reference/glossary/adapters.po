"Adapters are plug-ins to `Mixer </docs/reference/glossary/#mixer>`_, "
"Istioâ€™s `policy and telemetry </docs/reference/config/policy-and-"
"telemetry/>`_ component, which enable it to interface with an open-ended "
"set of infrastructure backends that deliver core functionality, such as "
"logging, monitoring, quotas, ACL checking, and more. The exact set of "
"adapters used at runtime is determined through configuration and can "
"easily be extended to target new or custom infrastructure backends."
