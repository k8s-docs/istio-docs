"Istio maintains an internal service registry containing the set of "
"`services </docs/reference/glossary/#service>`_, and their corresponding "
"`service endpoints </docs/reference/glossary/#service-endpoint>`_, "
"running in a service mesh. Istio uses the service registry to generate "
"`Envoy </docs/reference/glossary/#envoy>`_ configuration."

"Istio does not provide `service discovery "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_discovery>`_, although most "
"services are automatically added to the registry by `Pilot "
"</docs/reference/glossary/#pilot>`_ adapters that reflect the discovered "
"services of the underlying platform (Kubernetes, Consul, plain DNS). "
"Additional services can also be registered manually using a "
"```ServiceEntry`` </docs/concepts/traffic-management/#service-entries>`_ "
"configuration."
