"Mesh federation is the act of exposing services between meshes and "
"enabling communication across mesh boundaries. Each mesh may expose a "
"subset of its services to enable one or more other meshes to consume the "
"exposed services. You can use mesh federation to enable communication "
"between meshes in a `multi-mesh deployment </docs/ops/deployment"
