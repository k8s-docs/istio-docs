"TLS origination occurs when an Istio proxy (sidecar or egress gateway) is"
" configured to accept unencrypted internal HTTP connections, encrypt the "
"requests, and then forward them to HTTPS servers that are secured using "
"simple or mutual TLS. This is the opposite of `TLS termination "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy>`_ where an ingress "
"proxy accepts incoming TLS connections, decrypts the TLS, and passes "
"unencrypted requests on to internal mesh services."
