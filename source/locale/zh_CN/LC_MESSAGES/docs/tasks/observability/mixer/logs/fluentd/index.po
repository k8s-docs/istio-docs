"This task shows how to configure Istio to create custom log entries and "
"send them to a `Fluentd <https://www.fluentd.org/>`_ daemon. Fluentd is "
"an open source log collector that supports many `data outputs "
"<https://www.fluentd.org/dataoutputs>`_ and has a pluggable architecture."
" One popular logging backend is `Elasticsearch "
"<https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>`_, and `Kibana "
"<https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>`_ as a viewer. At the end of "
"this task, a new log stream will be enabled sending logs to an example "
"Fluentd / Elasticsearch / Kibana stack."
