"In Istio versions before 1.5, by default, the DNS certificates used by "
"the webhooks of Galley and the sidecar injector are provisioned and "
"managed by Citadel, which is a large component that maintains its own "
"signing key and also acts as a CA for Istio."

"In certain deployments, you may want to use your own certificate "
"authority instead of Citadel. In those cases, Citadel ends up being used "
"strictly for its DNS certificate provisioning functionality. Rather than "
"having to deploy Citadel at all in this case, you can instead leverage "
"Chiron, a lightweight component linked with Pilot that signs certificates"
" using the Kubernetes CA APIs without maintaining its own private key."
