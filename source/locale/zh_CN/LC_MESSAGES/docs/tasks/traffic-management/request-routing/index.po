"The Istio `Bookinfo </docs/examples/bookinfo/>`_ sample consists of four "
"separate microservices, each with multiple versions. Three different "
"versions of one of the microservices, ``reviews``, have been deployed and"
" are running concurrently. To illustrate the problem this causes, access "
"the Bookinfo app’s ``/productpage`` in a browser and refresh several "
"times. You’ll notice that sometimes the book review output contains star "
"ratings and other times it does not. This is because without an explicit "
"default service version to route to, Istio routes requests to all "
"available versions in a round robin fashion."
