"A common use case is to migrate TCP traffic gradually from one version of"
" a microservice to another. In Istio, you accomplish this goal by "
"configuring a sequence of rules that route a percentage of TCP traffic to"
" one service or another. In this task, you will send 100% of the TCP "
"traffic to ``tcp-echo:v1``. Then, you will route 20% of the TCP traffic "
"to ``tcp-echo:v2`` using Istio’s weighted routing feature."
