"Cloud platforms provide a wealth of benefits for the organizations that "
"use them. However, there’s no denying that adopting the cloud can put "
"strains on DevOps teams. Developers must use microservices to architect "
"for portability, meanwhile operators are managing extremely large hybrid "
"and multi-cloud deployments. Istio lets you connect, secure, control, and"
" observe services."

"At a high level, Istio helps reduce the complexity of these deployments, "
"and eases the strain on your development teams. It is a completely open "
"source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed "
"applications. It is also a platform, including APIs that let it integrate"
" into any logging platform, or telemetry or policy system. Istio’s "
"diverse feature set lets you successfully, and efficiently, run a "
"distributed microservice architecture, and provides a uniform way to "
"secure, connect, and monitor microservices."

"Istio addresses the challenges developers and operators face as "

"The term service mesh is used to describe the network of microservices "
"that make up such applications and the interactions between them. As a "
"service mesh grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to "
"understand and manage. Its requirements can include discovery, load "
"balancing, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring. A service mesh also"
" often has more complex operational requirements, like A/B testing, "
"canary rollouts, rate limiting, access control, and end-to-end "
"authentication."
