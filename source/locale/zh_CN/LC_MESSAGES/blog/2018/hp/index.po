"The FitStation team at HP strongly believes in the future of Kubernetes, "
"BPF and service-mesh as the next standards in cloud infrastructure. We "
"are also very happy to see Istio coming to its official Istio 1.0 release"
" – thanks to the joint collaboration that started at Google, IBM and Lyft"
" beginning in May 2017."

"Throughout the development of FitStation’s large scale and progressive "
"cloud platform, Istio, Cilium and Kubernetes technologies have delivered "
"a multitude of opportunities to make our systems more robust and "
"scalable. Istio was a game changer in creating reliable and dynamic "
"network communication."

"`FitStation powered by HP <http://www.fitstation.com>`_ is a technology "
"platform that captures 3D biometric data to design personalized footwear "
"to perfectly fit individual foot size and shape as well as gait profile. "
"It uses 3D scanning, pressure sensing, 3D printing and variable density "
"injection molding to create unique footwear. Footwear brands such as "
"Brooks, Steitz Secura or Superfeet are connecting to FitStation to build "
"their next generation of high performance sports, professional and "
"medical shoes."

"FitStation is built on the promise of ultimate security and privacy for "
"users’ biometric data. ISTIO is the cornerstone to make that possible for"
" data-at-flight within our cloud. By managing these aspects at the "
"infrastructure level, we focused on solving business problems instead of "
"spending time on individual implementations of secure service "
"communication. Using Istio allowed us to dramatically reduce the "
"complexity of maintaining a multitude of libraries and services to "
"provide secure service communication."

"As a bonus benefit of Istio 1.0, we gained network visibility, metrics "
"and tracing out of the box. This radically improved decision-making and "
"response quality for our development and devops teams. The team got in-"
"depth insight in the network communication across the entire platform, "
"both for new as well as legacy applications. The integration of Cilium "
"with Envoy delivered a remarkable performance benefit on Istio service "
"mesh communication, combined with a fine-grained kernel driven L7 network"
" security layer. This was due to the powers of BPF brought to Istio by "
"Cilium. We believe this will drive the future of Linux kernel security."

"It has been very exciting to follow Istio’s growth. We have been able to "
"see clear improvements of performance and stability over the different "
"development versions. The improvements between version 0.7 and 0.8 made "
"our teams feel comfortable with version 1.0, we can state that Istio is "
"now ready for real production usage."
