"Istio solves real problems that people encounter running microservices. "
"Even `very early pre-release versions "

"Last year, the Istio project experienced major growth. After a 9-month "
"gestation before the 1.1 release in Q1, we set a goal of having a "
"quarterly release cadence. We knew it was important to deliver value "
"consistently and predictably. With three releases landing in the "
"successive quarters as planned, we are proud to have reached that goal."

"During that time, we improved our build and test infrastructure, "
"resulting in higher quality and easier release cycles. We doubled down on"
" user experience, adding many commands to make operating and debugging "
"the mesh easier. We also saw tremendous growth in the number of "
"developers and companies contributing to the product - culminating in us "
"being `#4 on GitHub’s top ten list of fastest growing projects "

"We have ambitious goals for Istio in 2020 and there are many major "
"efforts underway, but at the same time we strongly believe that good "
"infrastructure should be “boring.” Using Istio in production should be a "
"seamless experience; performance should not be a concern, upgrades should"
" be a non-event and complex tasks should be automated away. With our "
"investment in a more powerful extensibility story we think the pace of "
"innovation in the service mesh space can increase while Istio focuses on "
"being gloriously dull. More details on our major efforts in 2020 below."

"Istio provided for extensibility from day one, implemented by a component"
" called Mixer. Mixer is a platform that allows custom `adapters "
"</docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/mixer-overview/#adapters>`_ "
"to act as an intermediary between the data plane and the backends you use"
" for policy or telemetry. Mixer necessarily added overhead to requests "
"because it required extensions to be out-of-process. So, we’re moving to "
"a model that enables extension directly in the proxies instead."

"The model that replaces Mixer uses extensions in Envoy to provide even "
"more capability. The Istio community is leading the implementation of a "
"`WebAssembly <https://webassembly.org/>`_ (Wasm) runtime in Envoy, which "
"lets us implement extensions that are modular, sandboxed, and developed "
"in one of `over 20 languages <https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-"
"langs>`_. Extensions can be dynamically loaded and reloaded while the "
"proxy continues serving traffic. Wasm extensions will also be able to "
"extend the platform in ways that Mixer simply couldn’t. They can act as "
"custom protocol handlers and transform payloads as they pass through "
"Envoy — in short they can do the same things as modules built into Envoy."

"We’re working with the Envoy community on ways to discover and distribute"
" these extensions. We want to make WebAssembly extensions as easy to "
"install and run as containers. Many of our partners have written Mixer "
"adapters, and together we are getting them ported to Wasm. We are also "
"developing guides and codelabs on how to write your own extensions for "
"custom integrations."

"Installing Istio 1.5 with the ‘preview’ configuration profile won’t "

"We are also simplifying the deployment of the rest of the control plane. "
"To that end, we combined several of the control plane components into a "
"single component: Istiod. This binary includes the features of Pilot, "
"Citadel, Galley, and the sidecar injector. This approach improves many "
"aspects of installing and managing Istio – reducing installation and "
"configuration complexity, maintenance effort, and issue diagnosis time "
"while increasing responsiveness. Read more about Istiod in `this post "
