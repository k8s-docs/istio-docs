"With Istio 1.5, Pilot Agent, Envoy, and Citadel Agent will be running in "
"the same container (the architecture is shown in the following diagram). "
"To defend against attackers eavesdropping on the cross-pod UDS between "
"Envoy (SDS client) and Citadel Agent (SDS server), Istio 1.5 merges Pilot"
" Agent and Citadel Agent into a single Istio Agent and makes the UDS "
"between Envoy and Citadel Agent private to the Istio Agent container. The"
" Istio Agent container is deployed as the sidecar of the application "
"service container."
