"```istioctl analyze`` </docs/reference/commands/istioctl/#istioctl-"
"experimental-analyze>`_ is a diagnostic tool that detects potential "
"issues with your Istio configuration, as well as gives general insights "
"to improve your configuration. It can run against a live cluster or a set"
" of local configuration files. It can also run against a combination of "
"the two, allowing you to catch problems before you apply changes to a "
"cluster."

"One of the key design goals that we followed for this feature is to make "

"In Istio 1.4, ``analyze`` comes with a nice set of analyzers that can "
