"Hyper-scale, microservice-based cloud environments have been exciting to "
"build but challenging to manage. Along came Kubernetes (container "
"orchestration) in 2014, followed by Istio (container service management) "
"in 2017. Both open-source projects enable developers to scale container-"
"based applications without spending too much time on administration "

"Istio 1.1 was designed for performance and scalability. The Istio "
"Performance and Scalability workgroup measured significant performance "
"improvements over 1.0. Istio 1.1 introduces new features and "
"optimizations to help harden the service mesh for enterprise microservice"
" workloads. The Istio 1.1 Performance and Tuning Guide documents "
"performance simulations, provides sizing and capacity planning guidance, "
"and includes best practices for tuning custom use cases."
