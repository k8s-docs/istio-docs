"Istio has two webhooks: Galley and the sidecar injector. Galley validates"
" Kubernetes resources and the sidecar injector injects sidecar containers"
" into Istio."

msgid ""
"By default, Galley and the sidecar injector manage their own webhook "
"configurations. This can pose a security risk if they are compromised, "
"for example, through buffer overflow attacks. Configuring a webhook is a "
"highly privileged operation as a webhook may monitor and mutate all "
"Kubernetes resources."

msgid ""
"In the following example, the attacker compromises Galley and modifies "
"the webhook configuration of Galley to eavesdrop on all Kubernetes "
"secrets (the ``clientConfig`` is modified by the attacker to direct the "
"``secrets`` resources to a service owned by the attacker)."

"To protect against this kind of attack, Istio 1.4 introduces a new "
"feature to securely manage webhooks using ``istioctl``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blog/2019/webhook/index.rst:27
msgid ""
"``istioctl``, instead of Galley and the sidecar injector, manage the "
"webhook configurations. Galley and the sidecar injector are de-privileged"
" so even if they are compromised, they will not be able to alter the "
"webhook configurations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blog/2019/webhook/index.rst:32
msgid ""
"Before configuring a webhook, ``istioctl`` will verify the webhook server"
" is up and that the certificate chain used by the webhook server is "
"valid. This reduces the errors that can occur before a server is ready or"
" if a server has invalid certificates."

"To try this new feature, refer to the `Istio webhook management task "
