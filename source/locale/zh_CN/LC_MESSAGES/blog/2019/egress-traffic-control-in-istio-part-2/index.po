"Welcome to part 2 in our new series about secure control of egress "
"traffic in Istio. In `the first part in the series </blog/2019/egress-"
"traffic-control-in-istio-part-1/>`_, I presented the attacks involving "
"egress traffic and the requirements we collected for a secure control "
"system for egress traffic. In this installment, I describe the Istio way "
"to securely control the egress traffic, and show how Istio can help you "
"prevent the attacks."

"To implement secure control of egress traffic in Istio, you must `direct "

" gateway </docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress/egress-gateway/#egress-"

"Both alternatives have their pros and cons, you should choose between "
"them according to your circumstances. The choice mainly depends on "
"whether your application can send unencrypted HTTP requests and whether "
"your organization’s security policies allow sending unencrypted HTTP "
"requests. For example, if your application uses some client library that "
"encrypts the traffic without a possibility to cancel the encryption, you "
"cannot use the option of sending unencrypted HTTP traffic. The same in "
"the case your organization’s security policies do not allow sending "
"unencrypted HTTP requests **inside the pod** (outside the pod the traffic"
" is encrypted by Istio)."

"for example, the `Kubernetes network policies "
"<https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-"

"You must also ensure that Istio control plane and the egress gateway "
