"Given how branching works, if you submit a change into the master branch,"
" that change won’t appear on ``istio.io`` until the next major Istio "
"release happens. If your documentation change is relevant to the current "
"Istio release, then it’s probably worth also applying your change to the "
"current release branch. You can do this easily and automatically by using"
" the special cherry-pick labels on your documentation PR. For example, if"
" you introduce a correction in a PR to the master branch, you can apply "

"On rare occasions, automatic cherry picks don’t work. When that happens, "
