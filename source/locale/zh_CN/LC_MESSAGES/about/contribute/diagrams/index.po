"If your diagram depicts a process, **do not add the descriptions of the "
"steps** to the diagram. Instead, only add the numbers of the steps to the"
" diagram and add the descriptions of the steps as a numbered list in the "
"document. Ensure that the numbers on the list match the numbers on your "
"diagram. This approach helps make diagrams easier to understand and the "
"content more accessible."
