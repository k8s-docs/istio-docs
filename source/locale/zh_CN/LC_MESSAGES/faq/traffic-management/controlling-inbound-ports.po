"Istio captures inbound traffic on all ports by default. You can override "
"this behavior using the ``traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts`` "
"pod annotation to specify an explicit list of ports to capture, or using "
"``traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts`` to specify a list of "
"ports to bypass."
