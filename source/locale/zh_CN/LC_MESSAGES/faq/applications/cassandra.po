"By default, Cassandra broadcasts the address it uses for binding "
"(accepting connections) to other Cassandra nodes as its address. This is "
"usually the pod IP address and works fine without a service mesh. "
"However, with a service mesh this configuration does not work. Istio and "
"other service meshes require ``localhost`` (``127.0.0.1``) to be the "
"address for binding."

"There are two configuration parameters to pay attention to: "
"```listen_address`` "
"<http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/configuration/cassandra_config_file.html?highlight=listen_address"
"#listen-address>`_ and ```broadcast_address`` "
"<http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/configuration/cassandra_config_file.html?highlight=listen_address"
"#broadcast-address>`_. For running Cassandra in an Istio mesh, the "
"``listen_address`` parameter should be set to ``127.0.0.1`` and the "
"``broadcast_address`` parameter should be set to the pod IP address."

"These configuration parameters are defined in ``cassandra.yaml`` in the "
"Cassandra configuration directory (e.g.Â ``/etc/cassandra``). There are "
"various startup scripts (and yaml files) used for starting Cassandra and "
"care should be given to how these parameters are set by these scripts. "
"For example, some scripts used to configure and start Cassandra use the "
"value of the environment variable ``CASSANDRA_LISTEN_ADDRESS`` for "
"setting ``listen_address``."
