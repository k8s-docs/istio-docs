"There are two Elasticsearch configuration parameters that need to be set "
"appropriately to run Elasticsearch with Istio: ``network.bind_host`` and "
"``network.publish_host``. By default, these parameters are set to the "
"``network.host`` parameter. If ``network.host`` is set to ``0.0.0.0``, "
"Elasticsearch will most likely pick up the pod IP as the publishing "
"address and no further configuration will be needed."

"If the default configuration does not work, you can set the "
"``network.bind_host`` to ``0.0.0.0`` or ``localhost`` (``127.0.0.1``) and"
" ``network.publish_host`` to the pod IP. For example:"
