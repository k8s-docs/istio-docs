"By default, Mixer participates in tracing by generating its own spans for"
" requests that are already selected for tracing by Envoy proxies. This "
"enables operators to observe the participation of the mixer-based policy "
"enforcement mechanisms within the mesh. If the ``istio-policy`` "
"configuration is disabled mesh-wide, Mixer does not participate in "
"tracing in this way."

"Mixer, operating as the ``istio-telemetry`` service, can also be used to "
"generate trace spans for data plane traffic. Mixerâ€™s Stackdriver adapter "
"is an example of an adapter that supports this capability."

"For Mixer-generated traces, Istio still relies on Envoy to generate trace"
" context and to forward it to the applications that must propagate the "
"context. Instead of Envoy itself sending trace information directly to a "
"tracing backend, Mixer distills client and server spans from the regular "
"Envoy reporting for each request based on operator-supplied "
"configuration. In this way, operators can precisely control when and how "
"trace data is generated and perhaps remove certain services entirely from"
" a trace or provide more detailed information for certain namespaces."
