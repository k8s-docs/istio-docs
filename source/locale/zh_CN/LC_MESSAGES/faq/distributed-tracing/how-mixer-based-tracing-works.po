"For Mixer-based tracing integrations, Mixer (addressed through the "
"``istio-telemetry`` service) provides the integration with tracing "
"backends. The Mixer integration allows additional levels of operator "
"control of the distributed tracing, including fine-grained selection of "
"the data included in trace spans. It also provides the ability to send "
"traces to backends not supported by Envoy directly."
