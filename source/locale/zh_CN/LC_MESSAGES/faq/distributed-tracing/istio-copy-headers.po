"Although an Istio sidecar will process both inbound and outbound requests"
" for an associated application instance, it has no implicit way of "
"correlating the outbound requests to the inbound request that caused "
"them. The only way this correlation can be achieved is if the application"
" propagates relevant information (i.e.Â headers) from the inbound request "
"to the outbound requests. Header propagation may be accomplished through "
"client libraries or manually. Further discussion is provided in `What is "
"required for distributed tracing with Istio? </faq/distributed-tracing"
"/#how-to-support-tracing>`_."
