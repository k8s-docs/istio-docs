"Since Istio 1.0.3, the sampling rate for tracing has been reduced to 1% "
"in the ``default`` `configuration profile </docs/setup/additional-setup"
"/config-profiles/>`_. This means that only 1 out of 100 trace instances "
"captured by Istio will be reported to the tracing backend. The sampling "
"rate in the ``demo`` profile is still set to 100%. See `this section "
"</docs/tasks/observability/distributed-tracing/overview/#trace-"
"sampling>`_ for more information on how to set the sampling rate."

"If you still do not see any trace data, please confirm that your ports "
"conform to the Istio `port naming conventions </faq/traffic-management"
"/#naming-port-convention>`_ and that the appropriate container port is "
"exposed (via pod spec, for example) to enable traffic capture by the "
"sidecar proxy (Envoy)."

"If you only see trace data associated with the egress proxy, but not the "
