"Istio enables reporting of trace spans for workload-to-workload "
"communications within a mesh. However, in order for various trace spans "
"to be stitched together for a complete view of the traffic flow, "
"applications must propagate the trace context between incoming and "
"outgoing requests."

"In particular, Istio relies on applications to `propagate the B3 trace "
"headers <https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation>`_, as well as the "
"Envoy-generated request ID. These headers include:"

"`Jaeger <https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java/tree/master"
