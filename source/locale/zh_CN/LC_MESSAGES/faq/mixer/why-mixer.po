"Mixer provides a rich intermediation layer between the Istio components "
"as well as Istio-based services, and the infrastructure backends used to "
"perform access control checks and telemetry capture. This layer enables "
"operators to have rich insights and control over service behavior without"
" requiring changes to service binaries."

"Mixer is designed as a stand-alone component, distinct from Envoy. This "
"has numerous benefits:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Scalability*. The work that Mixer and Envoy do is very different in "
"nature, leading to different scalability requirements. Keeping the "
"components separate enables independent component-appropriate scaling."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/mixer/why-mixer.rst:18
msgid ""
"*Resource Usage*. Istio depends on being able to deploy many instances of"
" its proxy, making it important to minimize the cost of each individual "
"instance. Moving Mixerâ€™s complex logic into a distinct component makes it"
" possible for Envoy to remain svelte and agile."

"*Reliability*. Mixer and its open-ended extensibility model represents "
"the most complex parts of the data path processing pipeline. By hosting "
"this functionality in Mixer rather than Envoy, it creates distinct "
"failure domains which enables Envoy to continue operating even if Mixer "
"fails, preventing outages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/mixer/why-mixer.rst:30
msgid ""
"*Isolation*. Mixer provides a level of insulation between Istio and the "
"infrastructure backends. Each Envoy instance can be configured to have a "
"very narrow scope of interaction, limiting the impact of potential "
"attacks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/mixer/why-mixer.rst:35
msgid ""
"*Extensibility*. It was imperative to design a simple extensibility model"
" to allow Istio to interoperate with as widest breath of backends as "
"possible. Due to its design and language choice, Mixer is inherently "
"easier to extend than Envoy is. The separation of concerns also makes it "
"possible to use Istio policy and telemetry processing with different "
"proxies, just as a mix of Envoy and NGINX."

"Envoy implements sophisticated caching, batching, and prefetching, to "
"largely mitigate the latency impact of needing to interact with Mixer on "
"the request path."
