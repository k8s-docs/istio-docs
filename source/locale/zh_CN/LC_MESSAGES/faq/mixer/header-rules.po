"Mixer rules must be valid to be applied at runtime. That means the match "
"conditions are well-defined expressions in the `language "
"</docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/expression-language/>`_, the"
" attributes are declared in an `attribute manifest "
"</docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/attribute-vocabulary/>`_, "
"and rules have no dangling references to handlers and instances."

"The attribute values are typically normalized before evaluating rules on "
"them. For example, HTTP headers have lowercase keys in "
"``request.headers`` and ``response.headers`` attributes. An expression "
"``request.headers[\"X-Forwarded-Proto\"] == \"http\"`` does not match any"
" request even though HTTP headers are case-insensitive. Instead, use an "
"expression ``request.headers[\"x-forwarded-proto\"] == \"http\"``."
