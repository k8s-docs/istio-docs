"Today, we’re excited to announce Istio 1.0! It’s been a little over a "
"year since our initial 0.1 release. Since then, Istio has evolved "
"significantly with the help of a thriving and growing community of "
"contributors and users. We’ve now reached the point where many companies "
"have successfully adopted Istio in production and have gotten real value "
"from the insight and control it provides over their deployments. We’ve "
"helped large enterprises and fast-moving startups like `eBay "
"<https://www.ebay.com/>`_, `Auto Trader UK "
"<https://www.autotrader.co.uk/>`_, `Descartes Labs "
"<http://www.descarteslabs.com/>`_, `HP FitStation "
"<https://www.fitstation.com/>`_, `JUSPAY <https://juspay.in>`_, `Namely "
"<https://www.namely.com/>`_, `PubNub <https://www.pubnub.com/>`_ and "
"`Trulia <https://www.trulia.com/>`_ use Istio to connect, manage and "
"secure their services from the ground up. Shipping this release as 1.0 is"
" recognition that we’ve built a core set of functionality that our users "
"can rely on for production use."

"We’ve seen substantial growth in Istio’s ecosystem in the last year. "
"`Envoy <https://www.envoyproxy.io/>`_ continues its impressive growth and"
" added numerous features that are crucial for a production quality "
"service mesh. Observability providers like `Datadog "
"<https://www.datadoghq.com/>`_, `SolarWinds "
"<https://www.solarwinds.com/>`_, `Sysdig <https://sysdig.com/blog"
"/monitor-istio/>`_, `Google Stackdriver "
"<https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/>`_ and `Amazon CloudWatch "
"<https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/>`_ have written plugins to integrate "
"Istio with their products. `Tigera <https://www.tigera.io/resources"
"/using-network-policy-concert-istio-2/>`_, `Aporeto "
"<https://www.aporeto.com/>`_, `Cilium <https://cilium.io/>`_ and `Styra "
"<https://styra.com/>`_ built extensions to our policy enforcement and "
"networking capabilities. `Red Hat <https://www.redhat.com/en>`_ built "
"`Kiali <https://www.kiali.io>`_ to wrap a nice user-experience around "
"mesh management and observability. `Cloud Foundry "
"<https://www.cloudfoundry.org/>`_ is building on Istio for it’s next "
"generation traffic routing stack, the recently announced `Knative "
"<https://github.com/knative/docs>`_ serverless project is doing the same "
"and `Apigee <https://apigee.com/>`_ announced that they plan to use it in"
" their API management solution. These are just some of the integrations "
"the community has added in the last year."

"Since the 0.8 release we’ve added some important new features and more "

"Multiple Kubernetes clusters can now be `added to a single mesh "

"Networking APIs that enable fine grained control over the flow of traffic"
" through a mesh are now Beta. Explicitly modeling ingress and egress "
"concerns using Gateways allows operators to `control the network topology"
" </blog/2018/v1alpha3-routing/>`_ and meet access security requirements "
"at the edge."

"Mutual TLS can now be `rolled out incrementally "
"</docs/tasks/security/authentication/mtls-migration>`_ without requiring "
"all clients of a service to be updated. This is a critical feature that "
"unblocks adoption in-place by existing production deployments."

"Mixer now has support for `developing out-of-process adapters "

"coming releases and makes building adapters much simpler."

"about what to focus next. We’ve heard consistent themes around support "

"scalability for massive deployments. We’ve already taken some of this "
