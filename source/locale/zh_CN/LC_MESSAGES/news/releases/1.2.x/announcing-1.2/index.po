"The theme of 1.2 is Predictable Releases - predictable in quality (we "
"want every release to be a good release) as well as in time (we want to "
"be able to ship on well known schedules)."

"As nearly anyone using Istio 1.0 noticed, it took us a long time to get "
"1.1 out. Far too long. One of the reasons was that we needed to do some "
"work on our testing and infrastructure – it was simply far too manual a "
"process to build, test and release. Because of that, 1.2 focuses on "
"improving the stability of these new features, and improving general "
"product health."

"In order to make release quality and timing predictable, we declared a "
"“Code Mauve”, meaning that we would spend the next iteration focusing on "
"project infrastructure. As a result, we’ve been investing a ton of effort"
" in our build, test and release machinery."

"We formed 3 new teams (GitHub Workflow, Source Organization, Testing "
"Methodology, and Build & Release Automation). Each had a set of issues to"
" take on and a set of exit criteria. Code Mauve isn’t over yet, in fact "
"we expect it to go on for some time. We’re putting in place the "
"infrastructure to measure the metrics each team decided on (paraphrasing "
"Peter Drucker: if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it)."

"In order to get features in the hands of our customers and users as soon "
"as possible, most of the new features from the last three months have "
"been delivered in 1.1.x releases. With 1.2, those features are now "
"officially part of the release."

"We’re seeing early results from the usability group. In the release "
"notes, you’ll find that you can now set log levels for the control plane "
"and the data plane globally. You can use ```istioctl`` "
"</docs/reference/commands/istioctl>`_ to validate that your Kubernetes "
"installation meets Istio’s requirements. And the new "
"``traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts`` annotation to eliminate "
"the need for service owner to declare ``containerPort`` in the deployment"
" yaml."

"Some of the features have matured as well. The following features have "
"progressed from Beta status to Stable: SNI at ingress, distributed "
"tracing, and service tracing. The following features have reached beta "
"status: cert management on ingress, configuration resource validation, "
"and configuration processing with Galley. We know there are lots of "
"feature requests outstanding, and we have an exciting roadmap (watch for "
"a forthcoming post from the TOC on that). The work we have done in this "
"release has taken care of some technical debt which will help us get "
"those features out reliably in future."
