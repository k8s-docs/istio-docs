"`CVE-2019-18801 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18801>`_: Fix a vulnerability affecting "
"Envoy’s processing of large HTTP/2 request headers. A successful "
"exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service, "
"escalation of privileges, or information disclosure. `CVE-2019-18802 "
"<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18802>`_: Fix a "
"vulnerability resulting from whitespace after HTTP/1 header values which "
"could allow an attacker to bypass Istio’s policy checks, potentially "
"resulting in information disclosure or escalation of privileges. "
"`CVE-2019-18838 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18838>`_: Fix a vulnerability resulting "
"from malformed HTTP request missing the “Host” header. An encoder filter "
"that invokes Envoy’s route manager APIs that access request’s “Host” "
"header will cause a NULL pointer to be dereferenced and result in "
"abnormal termination of the Envoy process."
