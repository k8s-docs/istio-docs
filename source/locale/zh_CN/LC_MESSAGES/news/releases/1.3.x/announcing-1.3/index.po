msgid ""
"To take advantage of Istio’s routing features, service ports must use a "
"special port naming format to explicitly declare the protocol. This "
"requirement can cause problems for users that do not name their ports "
"when they add their applications to the mesh. Starting with 1.3, the "
"protocol for outbound traffic is automatically detected as HTTP or TCP "
"when the ports are not named according to Istio’s conventions. We will be"
" polishing this feature in the upcoming releases with support for "
"protocol sniffing on inbound traffic as well as identifying protocols "
"other than HTTP."

"Yes, you read that right! We implemented most of the common security "
"policies, such as RBAC, directly into Envoy. We previously turned off the"
" ``istio-policy`` service by default and are now on track to migrate most"
" of Mixer’s telemetry functionality into Envoy as well. In this release, "
"we have enhanced the Istio proxy to emit HTTP metrics directly to "
"Prometheus, without requiring the ``istio-telemetry`` service to enrich "
"the information. This enhancement is great if all you care about is "
"telemetry for HTTP services. Follow the `Mixer-less HTTP telemetry "
"instructions <https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Mixerless-HTTP-"
"Telemetry>`_ to experiment with this feature. We are polishing this "
"feature in the coming months to add telemetry support for TCP services "
"when you enable Istio mutual TLS."

"Previous releases required that pods explicitly declare the Kubernetes "

"trampolining traffic. Istio 1.3 has a secure and simpler way of handling "
"all inbound traffic on any port into a {{< gloss >}}workload instance{{< "
"/gloss >}} without requiring the ``containerPort`` declarations. We have "
"also completely eliminated the infinite loops caused in the IP tables "
"rules when workload instances send traffic to themselves."
