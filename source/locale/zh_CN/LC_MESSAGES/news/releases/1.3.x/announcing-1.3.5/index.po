"`CVE-2019-18817 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18817>`_: An infinite loop can be triggered"
" in Envoy if the option ``continue_on_listener_filters_timeout`` is set "
"to True, which is the case in Istio. This vulnerability could be "
"leveraged for a DoS attack. If you applied the mitigation mentioned in "
"`our November 11, 2019 news post </news/security/istio-"
"security-2019-006>`_, you can remove the mitigation once you upgrade to "
"Istio 1.3.5 or newer."
