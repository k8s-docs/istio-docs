"Two security vulnerabilities have recently been identified in the Envoy "
"proxy (`CVE 2019-9900 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9900>`_ and `CVE 2019-9901 "
"<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9901>`_). The "
"vulnerabilities have now been patched in Envoy version 1.9.1, and "
"correspondingly in the Envoy builds embedded in Istio 1.1.2 and Istio "
"1.0.7. Since Envoy is an integral part of Istio, users are advised to "

" HTTP URI paths and did not fully validate HTTP/1.1 header values. These "
"vulnerabilities impact Istio features that rely on Envoy to enforce any "
