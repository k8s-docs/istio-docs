"A `panic in the Node Agent "
"<https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/13325>`_ was discovered late in "
"the 1.1.3 qualification process. The panic only occurs in clusters with "
"the alpha-quality SDS certificate rotation feature enabled. Since this is"
" the first time we have included SDS certificate rotation in our long-"
"running release tests, we don’t know whether this is a latent bug or a "
"new regression. Considering SDS certificate rotation is in alpha, we have"
" decided to release 1.1.3 with this issue and target a fix for the 1.1.4 "
