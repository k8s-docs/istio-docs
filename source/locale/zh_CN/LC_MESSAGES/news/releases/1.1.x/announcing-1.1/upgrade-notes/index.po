"Istio 1.0.x to 1.1.x. Here we detail cases where we intentionally broke "
"backwards compatibility. We also mention cases where backwards "
"compatibility was preserved but new behavior was introduced that would be"
" surprising to someone familiar with the use and operation of Istio 1.0."

"Istio’s CRDs have been placed into their own Helm chart ``istio-init``. "
"This prevents loss of custom resource data, facilitates the upgrade "
"process, and enables Istio to evolve beyond a Helm-based installation. "
"The `upgrade documentation </docs/setup/upgrade/>`_ provides the proper "
"procedures for upgrading from Istio 1.0.6 to Istio 1.1. Please follow "
"these instructions carefully when upgrading. If ``certmanager`` is "
"desired, use the ``--set certmanager=true`` flag when installing both "
"``istio-init`` and Istio charts with either ``template`` or ``tiller`` "
"installation modes."
