"**New ``Sidecar`` Resource**. The new `sidecar </docs/concepts/traffic-"

"the behavior of the sidecar proxies attached to workloads within a "

"sidecar will send traffic to. This reduces the amount of configuration "
"computed and transmitted to the proxy, improving startup time, resource "
"consumption and control-plane scalability. For large deployments, we "
"recommend adding a sidecar resource per namespace. Controls are also "
