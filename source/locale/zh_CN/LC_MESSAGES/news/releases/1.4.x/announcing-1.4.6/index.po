"`CVE-2020-8659 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8659>`_: The Envoy proxy may consume "
"excessive memory when proxying HTTP/1.1 requests or responses with many "
"small (i.e. 1 byte) chunks. Envoy allocates a separate buffer fragment "
"for each incoming or outgoing chunk with the size rounded to the nearest "
"4Kb and does not release empty chunks after committing data. Processing "
"requests or responses with a lot of small chunks may result in extremely "
"high memory overhead if the peer is slow or unable to read proxied data. "
"The memory overhead could be two to three orders of magnitude more than "
"configured buffer limits."

"`CVE-2020-8660 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8660>`_: The Envoy proxy contains a TLS "
"inspector that can be bypassed (not recognized as a TLS client) by a "
"client using only TLS 1.3. Because TLS extensions (SNI, ALPN) are not "
"inspected, those connections may be matched to a wrong filter chain, "
"possibly bypassing some security restrictions."

"`CVE-2020-8661 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8661>`_: The Envoy proxy may consume "
"excessive amounts of memory when responding to pipelined HTTP/1.1 "
"requests. In the case of illegally formed requests, Envoy sends an "
"internally generated 400 error, which is sent to the "
"``Network::Connection`` buffer. If the client reads these responses "
"slowly, it is possible to build up a large number of responses, and "
"consume functionally unlimited memory. This bypasses Envoy’s overload "
"manager, which will itself send an internally generated response when "
"Envoy approaches configured memory thresholds, exacerbating the problem."

"`CVE-2020-8664 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8664>`_: For the SDS TLS validation context"
" in the Envoy proxy, the update callback is called only when the secret "
"is received for the first time or when its value changes. This leads to a"
" race condition where other resources referencing the same secret (e.g,. "
"trusted CA) remain unconfigured until the secret’s value changes, "
"creating a potentially sizable window where a complete bypass of security"
" checks from the static (“default”) section can occur."

"This vulnerability only affects the SDS implementation of Istio’s "
"certificate rotation mechanism for Istio 1.4.5 and earlier which is only "
"when SDS and mutual TLS are enabled. SDS is off by default and must be "
"explicitly enabled by the operator in all versions of Istio prior to "
"Istio 1.5. Istio’s default secret distribution implementation based on "
"Kubernetes secret mounts is not affected by this vulnerability."
