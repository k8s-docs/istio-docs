"This page describes changes you need to be aware of when upgrading from "
"Istio 1.3.x to 1.4.x. Here, we detail cases where we intentionally broke "
"backwards compatibility. We also mention cases where backwards "
"compatibility was preserved but new behavior was introduced that would be"
" surprising to someone familiar with the use and operation of Istio 1.3."
