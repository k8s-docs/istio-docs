"Our implementation of telemetry without Mixer will simplify installation "
"and operation of meshes, all while vastly improving performance. The in-"
"proxy generation of HTTP metrics has graduated from experimental to "
"alpha. Users are very excited about this improvement and we are working "
"hard to get it ready. We’ve also added new experimental features that "
"don’t require Mixer: TCP metrics and Stackdriver metrics."

"``stat patterns``. Finally, there is a new `experimental command "
"</docs/reference/commands/istioctl/#istioctl-experimental-wait>`_ that "
"can tell you when configuration has been pushed to all proxies in the "
"mesh."
