"**Revamped Traffic Management Model**. We’re finally ready to take the "
"wraps off our `new traffic management APIs "
"</blog/2018/v1alpha3-routing/>`_. We believe this new model is easier to "
"understand while covering more real world deployment `use-cases "
"</docs/tasks/traffic-management/>`_. For folks upgrading from earlier "
"releases there is a `migration guide </docs/setup/upgrade/>`_ and a "
"conversion tool built into ``istioctl`` to help convert your "
"configuration from the old model."

"**Streaming Envoy configuration**. By default Pilot now streams "
"configuration to Envoy using its `ADS API <https://github.com/envoyproxy"
"/data-plane-api/blob/master/xds_protocol.rst>`_. This new approach "
"increases effective scalability, reduces rollout delay and should "
"eliminate spurious 404 errors."

"**Gateway for Ingress/Egress**. We no longer support combining Kubernetes"
" Ingress specs with Istio routing rules as it has led to several bugs and"
" reliability issues. Istio now supports a platform independent `Gateway "
"</docs/concepts/traffic-management/#gateways>`_ model for ingress & "
"egress proxies that works across Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry and works "
"seamlessly with routing. The Gateway supports `Server Name Indication "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`_ based routing, "
"as well as serving a certificate based on the server name presented by "
"the client."

"mutual TLS as well as end user authentication. This is now the "
"recommended way to control these behaviors."

"**A la Carte Istio**. Istio has a rich set of features, however you don’t"
" need to install or consume them all together. By using Helm or "

"For example, users can install Pilot only and enjoy traffic management "
