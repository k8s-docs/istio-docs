"`CVE-2019-18801 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18801>`_: This vulnerability affects "
"Envoy’s HTTP/1 codec in its way it processes downstream’s requests with "
"large HTTP/2 headers. A successful exploitation of this vulnerability "
"could lead to a denial of Service, escalation of privileges, or "
"information disclosure."

"`CVE-2019-18802 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18802>`_: HTTP/1 codec incorrectly fails to"
" trim whitespace after header values. This could allow an attacker to "
"bypass Istio’s policy either for information disclosure or escalation of "
"privileges."

"`CVE-2019-18838 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18838>`_: Upon receipt of a malformed HTTP "
"request without the “Host” header, an encoder filter invoking Envoy’s "
"route manager APIs that access request’s “Host” header will cause a NULL "
"pointer to be dereferenced and result in abnormal termination of the "
"Envoy process."

"Both Istio gateways and sidecars are vulnerable to this issue. If you are"
" running one of the affected releases where downstream’s requests are "
"HTTP/2 while upstream’s are HTTP/1, then your cluster is vulnerable. We "
"expect this to be true of most clusters."
