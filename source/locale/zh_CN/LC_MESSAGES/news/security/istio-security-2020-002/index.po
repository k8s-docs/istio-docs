"Note: We regret that the vulnerability was silently fixed in Istio 1.4.0 "

"<https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/17692>`_ in Istio 1.4.0 as a non-"

"`CVE-2020-8843 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8843>`_: Under certain circumstances it is "
"possible to bypass a specifically configured Mixer policy. Istio-proxy "
"accepts ``x-istio-attributes`` header at ingress that can be used to "
"affect policy decisions when Mixer policy selectively applies to source "
"equal to ingress. To be vulnerable, Istio must have Mixer Policy enabled "
"and used in the specified way. This feature is disabled by default in "
"Istio 1.3 and 1.4."
