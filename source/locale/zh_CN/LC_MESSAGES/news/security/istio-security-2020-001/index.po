"`CVE-2020-8595 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-"
"bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8595>`_: A bug in Istio’s Authentication "
"Policy exact path matching logic allows unauthorized access to resources "
"without a valid JWT token. This bug affects all versions of Istio that "
"support JWT Authentication Policy with path based trigger rules. The "
"logic for the exact path match in the Istio JWT filter includes query "
"strings or fragments instead of stripping them off before matching. This "
"means attackers can bypass the JWT validation by appending ``?`` or ``#``"
" characters after the protected paths."
