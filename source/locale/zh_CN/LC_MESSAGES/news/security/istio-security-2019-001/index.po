"During review of the `Istio 1.1.7 "
"</news/releases/1.1.x/announcing-1.1.7>`_ release notes, we realized that"
" `issue 13868 <https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/13868>`_, which is "
"fixed in the release, actually represents a security vulnerability."

"Initially we thought the bug was impacting the `TCP Authorization </about"
"/feature-stages/#security-and-policy-enforcement>`_ feature advertised as"
" alpha stability, which would not have required invoking this security "
"advisory process, but we later realized that the `Deny Checker "
"</docs/reference/config/policy-and-telemetry/adapters/denier/>`_ and "
"`List Checker </docs/reference/config/policy-and-"
"telemetry/adapters/list/>`_ feature were affected and those are "
"considered stable features. We are revisiting our processes to flag "
"vulnerabilities that are initially reported as bugs instead of through "
"the `private disclosure process </about/security-vulnerabilities/>`_."
