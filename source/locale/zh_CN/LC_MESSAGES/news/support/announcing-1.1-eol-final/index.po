"Since we learned of the security vulnerability `behind our October 8th "
"security release </news/security/istio-security-2019-005>`_ while still "
"barely within the 1.1 support period, we decided to extend the 1.1 "
"support period beyond the original announcement and release `1.1.16 "
"</news/releases/1.1.x/announcing-1.1.16>`_. Then we discovered a `bug in "
"HTTP header size calculation "
"<https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/17735>`_ was introduced by the "
"security release, so we decided to release a fix in one last `1.1.17 "
"</news/releases/1.1.x/announcing-1.1.17>`_ release before closing out the"
" 1.1 series for good."

"At this point we will no longer back-port fixes for security issues and "
"critical bugs to 1.1, so we heartily encourage you to upgrade to the "
"latest version of Istio ({{}}) if you havenâ€™t already."
